Achieving fairness in product development is a shared responsibility among all stakeholders, including developers, business analysts, product owners, designers, and user researchers. Expecting developers alone to analyse and apply all fairness notions throughout the entire development pipeline is unrealistic. They are also human and may have other work-related tasks, or personal distractions, or just be affected by current events.

In a product development process, each team member brings a unique skill set with different capabilities. This skill and capability difference makes it challenging to establish a common language across the development process. To address this, we created fairness team templates, or "*team*plates," to facilitate collaboration and integrate diverse expertise into a cohesive codebase.
