# Participation Tools

Increasing participation is one of the fundamental task to achieve truly equitable AI development, which requires a multifaceted approach involving identifying barriers to entry, promoting inclusivity, and providing avenues for engagement. Education and training programmes to diverse backgrounds (e.g. AI4ALL), community engagement initiative to share knowledge and collaborate (e.g. The Black in AI community), democratising the research initiatives and funding projects (e.g. Collective Intelligence Project [^cip]) is crucial. But, in this document, our focus will be the digital tools and collaboration examples that successfully accelerated the equitable AI development.

## Digital Collaboration in the Dataset Collection 


Leveraging digital collaboration tools can facilitate remote participation and collaboration, making it easier for individuals from different geographical locations to contribute to AI development projects.

Most software developers use GitHub to enable collaborative software development. It allows developers from around the world to contribute to AI projects and share their expertise. A similar initiative in the AI development is Huggingface, which achieved tramendous success compared to compotetitors. These open-source collaboration and sharing platforms accelerated the pace of the AI development.

Despite the democritised and collaborative development environment in the algorithm side, collecting a dataset is still a challenge. The most common approach is utilising Mechanical Turk.

### Case Study: Cohere Aya

<https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06619.pdf>

3,000 independent researchers across 119 countries collaborated to build a state-of-art model and dataset that performs multilingual capabilities for 101 languages.


### Case Study: pol.is

A real-time system for to gather, analyse and interpret crowd-sourced information. Starting in 2014, the system is deployed by Taiwanese government to enable effective group decision making [^polis].



## Creating Guidelines and Frameworks Together

Establishing clear ethical guidelines and frameworks for AI development can help ensure that the technology is developed in a responsible and equitable manner, fostering trust and participation from a broader range of stakeholders.

The IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems develops standards and guidelines for the ethical design and implementation of AI systems.

### Case Study: ML Commons
