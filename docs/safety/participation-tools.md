# Participation Tools

Increasing participation is one of the fundamental task to achieve truly equitable AI development, which requires a multifaceted approach involving identifying barriers to entry, promoting inclusivity, and providing avenues for engagement. Education and training programmes to diverse backgrounds, community engagement initiative to share knowledge and collaborate (e.g. [The ODI](https://theodi.org/)), democratising the research initiatives and funding projects (e.g. [Collective Intelligence Projec](https://cip.org/whitepaper)) is crucial. 

In this document, we do not give a step-by-step guidelines for participation, but share two real-life initiatives that accelerated "democratic" AI rapidly:

## Case Study: Cohere Aya

3,000 independent researchers across 119 countries collaborated to build a state-of-art model and dataset that performs multilingual capabilities for 101 languages.


## Case Study: pol.is

A real-time system for to gather, analyse and interpret crowd-sourced information. Starting in 2014, the system is deployed by Taiwanese government to enable effective group decision making (<https://compdemocracy.org/Case-studies/2014-vTaiwan/>).
