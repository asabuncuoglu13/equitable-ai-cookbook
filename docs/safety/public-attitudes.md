# Public Attitudes to AI

We witnessed rapid advencement and growing popularity in AI in the last couple of years. In early 2024, the U.S. equity markets reached multiple all-time highs, driven largely by investors' growing enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI) {cite}`j_p_morgan_private_bank_how_2024`. Microsoft’s New Future of Work Report 2023 demonstrated that the integration of LLMs is not only expected into internal applications, but many companies will also include them as client and worker-facing applications {cite}`butler_microsoft_2023`. AI has been integrated into an array of tasks including LLMs for information work, critical thinking, human-AI collaboration, complex and creative tasks, domain-specific applications, and team collaboration.

The recent trend in investment on AI-powered services has shown that investors are increasingly building their strategies around the AI capabilities of businesses. In this competitive environment, companies are prioritising the rapid development of new AI functions with a primary focus on accuracy, often at the expense of inclusivity. Consequently, the public is likely to encounter more AI-powered tools that may lack inclusive and fair practices. Therefore, it is crucial to understand both perspectives: (1) public attitudes to AI and (2) the efforts businesses are making to develop AI capabilities. This understanding can guide companies to create services that are more equitable, inclusive, and fair.

*Public Attitudes to AI* was also the name of CDEI’s (now it is called RTAU) 2024 report {cite}`cdei_24`. 95% of survey participants from the public claim that they heard of AI, with a significant portion (66%) stating they can provide at least a partial definition of it. Despite increasing familiarity and utilization of AI, persistent concerns are associated with the technology, with feelings of scary, worry, and unsure being frequently expressed.

The adoption of LLMs is quite prevalent, with around a third (34%) of the UK populace utilising chatbots in their personal lives on a monthly basis, and a quarter (24%) incorporating them into their work routines. Consequently, self-reported awareness and comprehension of AI among the UK public have shown an uptick since last year across various demographic segments, encompassing older individuals, those from lower socio-economic backgrounds, and individuals with lower levels of digital proficiency.

The report also revealed that health (21%), the cost of living (18%), and the economy (8%) appeared as the most promising data-driven opportunities in the public eye. The rest of the <10% opportunities are also digital economy related.

**Understanding public opinion on AI is crucial when developing AI-enabled products and building "trust" around them. It can help us answer:**

- How can society benefit from the use of data or AI equally?
- How can we build the trust between organisations and citizens and ensure that organisations will be responsible for their actions?
- How can public change their perspective when the overall view on AI is pessimistic?
- How should we define the risk management strategies to help public to support the use of AI?
- How can we design AI-enabled systems for the citizens with lower digital literacy?

These questions are in the intersection of anthropology, psychology, sociology and computer science. Human-computer interaction, and more specially, human-AI interaction researchers try to solve these challenges for years. Our current interaction with computing devices such as computers and mobile phones are based on this exhaustive research. Chapter [Evaluating and Mitigating Fairness in Financial Services: A Human-AI Interaction Perspective](../usecases/finance/interaction.md) shares a use case where we utilised Human-AI interaction guidelines and standards to evaluate some of existing financial service applications. The next chapter summarises AI evaluation techniques for a comprehensive auditing.
