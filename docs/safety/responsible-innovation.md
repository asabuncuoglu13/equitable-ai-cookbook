# Responsible Innovation

In both academia and industry, we can see the growing gap between our ability to innovate and our capacity to foresee and manage its consequences. The current scale and pace with growing organisational needs makes the responsibility management process much more challenging. In this sense, technologies with uncertain impacts or lacking historical precedents requires a through analysis to managing risks responsibly. 

UKRI promotes the use of an RI framwork with four dimensions: Anticipatory, reflective, deliberative, and responsive {cite}`owen_framework_2013`. These dimensions encourage a shift from simply managing the products of innovation to proactively engaging with its purposes and underlying motivations, with a particular emphasis on inclusive and democratic governance. 

Throughout this cookbook, we emphasised heavily on developing and maintaining proactive approaches. It enables a "by-design" approach and prevents most of the concerns at the start of development process. This framework can be also adopted as another proactive practice to enable the responsible design of the research and business needs. 

To align our research activities with the reflective, anticipatory, deliberative, and responsive practices, we can define the following actions in the early stages of development process:

- The first step is to define the desired outcomes of innovation. This requires **reflection** on the values that should guide innovation and consideration of the potential benefits and burdens it might create. However, there may be tensions and conflicts among these targets, and the prioritization or exclusion of certain goals requires political and ethical discussion.
- Once the "right impacts" have been identified, it's crucial to **anticipate** both intended and unintended consequences of innovation. This involves using methodologies like foresight, technology assessment, and scenario development to explore various pathways and potential outcomes. By asking "what if" questions, scientists and innovators can identify potential risks and opportunities early on.
- Open and inclusive dialogue is vital for **deliberate** delivery of innovation. This involves inviting perspectives from publics and diverse stakeholders to reframe issues, identify potential areas of contestation, and ensure a democratic and equitable approach. We should also note that responsible innovation is a collective endeavor that requires collaboration and shared responsibility across the entire innovation ecosystem. Scientists, innovators, businesses, research funders, policymakers, and users all have a role to play in ensuring the ethical and socially responsible development of new technologies
- The overall management and governance process should enable **responsiveness** to new information, changing perspectives, and evolving social values. This requires the integration of effective mechanisms for participatory and anticipatory governance that allow for the modulation of innovation trajectories as new knowledge emerges.
