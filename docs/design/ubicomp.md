# Links to Ubiquitous Computing

Discussing trusted AI without mentioning the field of Ubicomp is hard.

In his 1996 talk, Weiser outlined a set of principles for ubiquitous computing:

- The purpose of a computer is to help you do something else.
- The best computer is a quiet, invisible servant.
- The more you can do by intuition, the smarter you are; the computer should extend your unconscious.
- Technology should create calm.

He coined the term Calm Technology with the following words, "... that which informs but doesn't demand our focus or attention."


Mark Weiser presented some challenges in his 1993 paper "Some Computer Science Problems in Ubiquitous Computing":

- Scalability: The challenge of building systems that can scale to handle the increasing amounts of data and users in a ubiquitous computing environment.
- Heterogeneity: The challenge of integrating a wide variety of devices and systems, with different capabilities and interfaces, into a coherent computing environment.
- Mobility: The challenge of designing systems that can accommodate mobile users and devices and that can adapt to changing network conditions and locations.
- Security and Privacy: The challenge of ensuring the security and privacy of users' data and devices in the face of increasingly sophisticated attacks and pervasive data collection.
- Context Awareness: The challenge of creating systems that can sense and respond to the context in which they are being used, including factors such as location, user preferences, and social and organizational context.
- Low Power: The challenge of designing systems that can operate for extended periods of time on limited power sources, such as batteries.
- User Interface: The challenge of designing interfaces that are intuitive and natural to use, and that can adapt to users' changing needs and contexts.

Although we demonstrated a great progress in all these challenges, the increasing scale of these ubiquitous systems also increased the scale of these challenges.
