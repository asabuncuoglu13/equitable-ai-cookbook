# Design Process of a Trusted AI

The design of a trusted AI system is a combination of efforts for building multiple tools, goods, and services, with a consideration of performance, reliability, and aesthetic expression. It also requires digesting scientific knowledge quickly from research and transforming it to sustainable systems. From this perspective, this is a classical design engineering problem.

Goods and services represent the outputs of an organisation, including artifacts and energy. A “product” is broadly defined as the result of any process [10], and can be categorized as follows: (1) hardware—physical, countable objects; (2) software—intangible information such as computer programs, laws, or insurance policies; (3) services—intangible outcomes from interactions between suppliers and customers, including utilities, transportation, waste management, policing, retail, advertising, information delivery, and ambience; and (4) processed materials—bulk solids, liquids, or gases measured by volume, mass, or energy, such as plastic pellets, fuel, grease, or coolant. This book classifies products as (A) living, (B) inanimate material, (C) energy, and (D) information (L, M, E, I), with “information” encompassing signals, commands, and related forms. Engineering products are distinguished from other types.

Accordingly, a designer should demonstrate:

1. Practical competency—using experience, design principles, heuristics, and technical data as guidelines.
2. Subject competency—knowledge of relevant fields and examples, including engineering sciences and realized systems.
3. Method competency—ability to apply and intuitively use design methods for analysis, experimentation, and creativity.
4. Systems competency—understanding broader implications, such as life cycle and economics.
5. Social competency—teamwork, communication, leadership, and awareness of social and cultural factors.
6. Economic competency—awareness of costs, returns, business, and political factors.

Systematic design engineering uses theory strategically to guide the design process. Methodical design engineering applies both new and established methods, combining theory, best practices, and intuition.

A focus on information flow -- also check Dix

The contents of information can concern tangible, process, and cognitive or conceptual objects. Process objects are further divided by purpose: (1) for practical use, such as manufacturing, distribution, operation, or disposal; or (2) for designing tangible or process objects [164].

An evaluation during designing can use one or more of the following questions:

- Type 1: How good is something? (demands for a total or a partial evaluation)
- Type 2: Does the solution correspond to the task definition?
- Type 3: Which of the proposed solutions is optimal?
- Type 4: What are the optimal values of some properties?

The probability of an error occurring during the verification depends on the degree of originality and complexity of the task (e.g., innovation), the quality of the task definition (e.g.,design specification), and on the state of the operators in the design process, especially of the designers.
