# Public Infrastructure: What does it mean?

Digital public infrastructure refers to the technological framework and services that underpin digital interactions and transactions within a society, akin to the concept of "public infrastructure" in traditional physical infrastructure. Three "digital" components (identification (ID), payment systems, and data platforms) build the core "infrastructure" to power up "public" services. Just as physical infrastructure like roads, bridges, and utilities supports economic and social activities, digital public infrastructure supports the functioning of a digital economy and society.

In this equitable AI cookbook, we give examples from DPIs, particularly from digital economy area. So, it is important to understand the concept and how equitable AI has become an accelerator of transformation in the public sector.

## A Historical Background

### Transportation Systems

Throughout history, transportation infrastructure has been pivotal in facilitating economic development, cultural exchange, and societal progress. Dating back to ancient times, Roman roads stand as a testament to the transformative power of transportation networks. Constructed over centuries across the vast Roman Empire, these roads facilitated trade, military conquests, and the spread of Roman culture and governance.

During the medieval period, the Silk Road emerged as a key trade route connecting the East and West, enabling the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultures between civilizations. The Silk Road facilitated the transmission of technologies such as papermaking, printing, and gunpowder, contributing to the advancement of science, commerce, and cultural diffusion.

The advent of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries brought about a paradigm shift in transportation infrastructure with the proliferation of canals, roads, and, most notably, railroads. Railways revolutionized long-distance travel and freight transport, catalyzing economic growth and urbanization. For example, the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad in the United States facilitated the westward expansion of the nation, connecting remote territories and fueling economic development.

In the modern era, transportation infrastructure continues to evolve to meet the demands of an interconnected world. Highways, airports, and seaports form the backbone of global trade, enabling the movement of goods and people across continents. Advanced transportation technologies, such as containerization and air freight, have further accelerated the pace of globalization, linking distant markets and fostering international cooperation.

Moreover, emerging technologies such as high-speed rail, electric vehicles, and autonomous transportation promise to revolutionize mobility and sustainability in the 21st century. Investments in smart infrastructure and digital connectivity aim to enhance efficiency, safety, and accessibility in transportation systems worldwide.

### Communication Networks

Communication networks, encompassing postal services and telecommunication systems, have been fundamental in connecting individuals, businesses, and societies across vast distances throughout history. 

Dating back to ancient civilizations, postal services served as essential means of communication, enabling the exchange of messages, documents, and goods. For instance, the Persian Empire established one of the earliest postal systems, known as the Royal Road, which facilitated communication and trade across its vast territories. Similarly, the Roman Empire operated an extensive network of courier services, providing reliable communication between distant provinces.

The invention of the telegraph in the 19th century revolutionized long-distance communication by enabling the transmission of electrical signals over wires. Pioneering telegraph networks, such as the transatlantic cable linking Europe and North America, facilitated rapid communication between continents, transforming business, diplomacy, and journalism.

Subsequent advancements in telecommunication technologies, such as the telephone and radio, further expanded the reach and speed of communication. The widespread adoption of telephony in the 20th century revolutionized personal and business communication, allowing individuals to converse in real-time across great distances. Similarly, radio broadcasting enabled the mass dissemination of news, entertainment, and cultural programming to audiences around the world.

In the digital age, the internet and mobile telecommunications have revolutionized communication on a global scale. The internet, born out of military and academic research in the late 20th century, has become an indispensable tool for information exchange, social interaction, and commerce. Email, instant messaging, social media, and other online platforms have transformed the way individuals communicate, breaking down barriers of time and space.

Mobile telecommunications, enabled by wireless technology, have brought connectivity to remote and underserved regions, empowering individuals with access to voice and data services. Mobile phones have become ubiquitous tools for communication, enabling individuals to stay connected, access information, and participate in the digital economy.

In summary, communication networks, from ancient postal services to modern-day telecommunications, have played a crucial role in connecting people, facilitating commerce, and disseminating information across time and space. As technology continues to advance, communication networks will remain essential in shaping the way we interact and engage with the world around us.

In each of these three examples, the infrastructure provided essential services or resources that were foundational to the functioning of society. Similarly, digital public infrastructure encompasses the digital platforms, networks, and services that support modern economic, social, and civic activities in the digital age.

The advances in the digital technology enabled governments, NGOs, public and private companies, and other initiatives to utilise these technologies to increase the access to services. However, without the responsible and equitable transition process, introducing digital technologies can inhibit the access.
