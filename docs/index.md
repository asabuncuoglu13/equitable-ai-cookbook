# Equitable AI Cookbook

Equitable AI involves creating and using artificial intelligence systems in a fair and just manner, ensuring they do not reinforce existing biases or discriminate against certain groups. It focuses on fairness, transparency, accountability, inclusivity, and ethical considerations to prevent unfair outcomes and promote equal opportunities for all individuals and communities. 

From an academic perspective, we can observe that equitable AI is an
established research area, and the existing research can guide us to
take confident steps to achieve trustworthiness in the era of large
foundational models. However, we should take the next steps in an
interdisciplinary and transparent fashion. This repository contains an
extensive list of techniques and experiments as an initial effort to
achieve this goal in the "digital economy" domain. In the digital
economy domain, we selected three use cases:

1.  Internal use of LLMs in financial services such as credit scoring
    and financial insight generation,
2.  Improving biometric facial verification using synthetic data
    generated by foundational models (e.g. diffusion models)
3.  Utilising LLMs in fraud detection in KYC (know-your-customer)
    systems.

This cookbook is an effort to bring the "best practices" together to achieve equitable AI, particularly focusin on the use cases from public services and digital economy.

## Contents

Although equitable AI requires a combined effort from multiple domains, 
we  focus on the sociotechnical and technical techniques, particularly
fairness, security and privacy. We do not go into details on governance,
auditing techniques, comprehensive assurance, but we mostly on technical
developments in fairness, security and privacy.
