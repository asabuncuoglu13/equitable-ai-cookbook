# Introduction to Best Practices

"Best practices" can widely refer to a set of techniques, methodologies, processes, or guidelines that are accepted as superior or most effective in a particular field or context. These practices are typically based on accumulated knowledge, experience, and empirical evidence of what works well and produces desirable outcomes. We can define "best practices" to optimize efficiency, productivity, quality, safety, or other desired outcomes.

When the desired outcome is achieving equal access/outcomes/participation/benefits and trustworthiness, defining the "best practices" becomes challenging as these are complex sociotechnical terms. For example, NIST defines "trustworthiness" with seven sub-components, and each subcomponent requires a careful evaluation based on specific use cases.


## Public Attitudes to AI

In early 2024, the U.S. equity markets reached multiple all-time highs, driven largely by investors' growing enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI) {cite}`j_p_morgan_private_bank_how_2024`. Microsoft’s New Future of Work Report 2023 demonstrated that the integration of LLMs is not only expected into internal applications, but many companies will also include them as client and worker-facing applications {cite}`butler_microsoft_2023`. It includes an array of tasks including LLMs for information work, critical thinking, human-AI collaboration, complex and creative tasks, domain-specific applications, team collaboration and communication, knowledge management and organisational change, future work and society.

**The recent trend in investment on AI-powered services has shown that investors are increasingly building their strategies around the AI capabilities of businesses. In this competitive environment, companies are prioritising the rapid development of new AI functions with a primary focus on accuracy, often at the expense of inclusivity. Consequently, the public is likely to encounter more AI-powered tools that may lack inclusive and fair practices. Therefore, it is crucial to understand both perspectives: (1) public opinion on AI and (2) the efforts businesses are making to develop AI capabilities. This understanding can guide companies to create services that are more equitable, inclusive, and fair.**

“Public Attitudes to AI” was also the name of CDEI’s 2024 report {cite}`cdei_24`. 95% of survey participants from the public claim that they heard of AI, with a significant portion (66%) stating they can provide at least a partial definition of it. Despite increasing familiarity and utilization of AI, persistent concerns are associated with the technology, with feelings of scary, worry, and unsure being frequently expressed.

The adoption of LLMs is quite prevalent, with around a third (34%) of the UK populace utilising chatbots in their personal lives on a monthly basis, and a quarter (24%) incorporating them into their work routines. Consequently, self-reported awareness and comprehension of AI among the UK public have shown an uptick since last year across various demographic segments, encompassing older individuals, those from lower socio-economic backgrounds, and individuals with lower levels of digital proficiency.

The report also revealed that health (21%), the cost of living (18%), and the economy (8%) appeared as the most promising data-driven opportunities in the public eye. The rest of the <10% opportunities are also digital economy related.

In this recent survey directed by CDEI, public opinion on AI related to trustworthy integration to public and private sector applications has been explored {cite}`cdei_24`. They listed six main outcomes:

1.  **Focus on equitable AI/Data:** How society can benefit from the use of data or AI equally.
2.  **Secure data flow:** Building confidence that organisations will be responsible for their actions.
3.  **Image of AI:** With the increasing AI experience, the public becomes more pessimistic about the outcomes.
4.  **Apprehensions about change:** Although increasing productivity in the day-to-day jobs are expected, there is also a concern mostly about job displacement.
5.  **The preference is situation-dependent:** Utilising AI in social good projects such as cancer detection and financial support is highly favourable. However, clear risk management strategies can help public to support the rest of the use cases.
6.  **Low digital familiarity:** If the end users have lower digital literacy, they tend to be more pessimistic about the use of AI/data.
