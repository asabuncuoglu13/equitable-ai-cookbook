# Red Teaming

Red teaming is a structured evaluation process that challenges and improves the effectiveness of plans, policies, systems, and assumptions. The concept is originating from defence and security. Typically, the process involves creating a "red team," which operates independently from the organization's primary team, the "blue team." The red team's objective is to simulate the perspectives, strategies, and tactics of adversaries/competitors.

In the context of AI, particularly in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, red teaming is an essential step towards robustness, safety, and integrity of these models. 

We can list some evaluation activities during the red teaming as following:

1. **Adversarial Testing**: Crafting inputs designed to trick or exploit vulnerabilities in the model, such as generating misleading or toxic responses.

2. **Ethical and Bias Analysis**: Adopting diverse perspectives and backgrounds, red team members can uncover hidden issues such as discriminative behaviour.

3. **Security Assessment**: Identifying vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure, data privacy risks, and potential avenues for malicious exploitation. 

4. **Scenario Planning**: Anticipating potential misuse or unintended consequences of LLMs by building hypothetical scenarios such as the spread of misinformation, manipulation of public opinion, or unintended reinforcement of harmful stereotypes.


## Some Best Practices from previous Read Teaming Events

### 2023 DEFCON

A policy briefing report {cite}`friedler_ai_2023` highlighted both the benefits and challenges associated with conducting red teaming activities. The report underscores the importance of thorough task definition for effective assessment and emphasizes that these activities serve as valuable initial steps in evaluating LLMs. However, it notes that attendees often lack the technical skills necessary to develop robust attack strategies. The report outlines four key elements for successful red teaming activities:
- Clear definition of the targeted flaws.
- Integration of transparency, disclosures, and external group access to the system.
- Inclusion of red teaming within a broader assessment framework.
- Commitment from stakeholders to allocate necessary plans and resources for addressing findings.
