# Trustworthy Digital Public Infrastructure

Digital public infrastructure refers to the technological framework and services that underpin digital interactions and transactions within a society, akin to the concept of "public infrastructure" in traditional physical infrastructure. Three "digital" components (identification (ID), payment systems, and data platforms) build the core "infrastructure" to power up "public" services. Just as physical infrastructure like roads, bridges, and utilities supports economic and social activities, digital public infrastructure supports the functioning of a digital economy and society.

In this equitable AI cookbook, we give examples from DPIs, particularly from digital economy area. So, it is important to understand the concept and how equitable AI has become an accelerator of transformation in the public sector.

## Public Infrastructure: A Historical Background

### Public Libraries

Libraries have historically served as vital repositories of knowledge and information, playing a pivotal role in facilitating the transition of information across generations and civilizations. For instance, institutions like the Library of Alexandria in Egypt and the House of Wisdom in Baghdad served as centers of learning, preserving manuscripts, and fostering scholarly exchange in ancient times. These early libraries not only safeguarded valuable texts but also facilitated the dissemination of knowledge through copying, translation, and scholarly discussions. 

In more recent history, public libraries played a crucial role in the dissemination of information during times of social and technological change. For example, during the Industrial Revolution, public libraries in Europe and North America provided access to educational materials and vocational resources, empowering individuals to adapt to the demands of an evolving economy.

In the digital era, public libraries continue to evolve as essential hubs for access to information and technology. They provide free or low-cost access to digital resources such as e-books, online databases, and educational websites, bridging the digital divide and promoting digital literacy among diverse communities. Libraries also offer technology training programs, coding workshops, and other resources to equip patrons with the skills needed to thrive in an increasingly digital world.

Furthermore, libraries serve as community gathering spaces where individuals can engage in lifelong learning, participate in cultural events, and access social services. By embracing digital technologies while upholding their traditional role as guardians of knowledge, public libraries remain indispensable institutions in the information age, fostering inclusivity, empowerment, and intellectual enrichment for all members of society.

### Transportation Systems

Throughout history, transportation infrastructure has been pivotal in facilitating economic development, cultural exchange, and societal progress. Dating back to ancient times, Roman roads stand as a testament to the transformative power of transportation networks. Constructed over centuries across the vast Roman Empire, these roads facilitated trade, military conquests, and the spread of Roman culture and governance.

During the medieval period, the Silk Road emerged as a key trade route connecting the East and West, enabling the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultures between civilizations. The Silk Road facilitated the transmission of technologies such as papermaking, printing, and gunpowder, contributing to the advancement of science, commerce, and cultural diffusion.

The advent of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries brought about a paradigm shift in transportation infrastructure with the proliferation of canals, roads, and, most notably, railroads. Railways revolutionized long-distance travel and freight transport, catalyzing economic growth and urbanization. For example, the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad in the United States facilitated the westward expansion of the nation, connecting remote territories and fueling economic development.

In the modern era, transportation infrastructure continues to evolve to meet the demands of an interconnected world. Highways, airports, and seaports form the backbone of global trade, enabling the movement of goods and people across continents. Advanced transportation technologies, such as containerization and air freight, have further accelerated the pace of globalization, linking distant markets and fostering international cooperation.

Moreover, emerging technologies such as high-speed rail, electric vehicles, and autonomous transportation promise to revolutionize mobility and sustainability in the 21st century. Investments in smart infrastructure and digital connectivity aim to enhance efficiency, safety, and accessibility in transportation systems worldwide.

### Communication Networks

Communication networks, encompassing postal services and telecommunication systems, have been fundamental in connecting individuals, businesses, and societies across vast distances throughout history. 

Dating back to ancient civilizations, postal services served as essential means of communication, enabling the exchange of messages, documents, and goods. For instance, the Persian Empire established one of the earliest postal systems, known as the Royal Road, which facilitated communication and trade across its vast territories. Similarly, the Roman Empire operated an extensive network of courier services, providing reliable communication between distant provinces.

The invention of the telegraph in the 19th century revolutionized long-distance communication by enabling the transmission of electrical signals over wires. Pioneering telegraph networks, such as the transatlantic cable linking Europe and North America, facilitated rapid communication between continents, transforming business, diplomacy, and journalism.

Subsequent advancements in telecommunication technologies, such as the telephone and radio, further expanded the reach and speed of communication. The widespread adoption of telephony in the 20th century revolutionized personal and business communication, allowing individuals to converse in real-time across great distances. Similarly, radio broadcasting enabled the mass dissemination of news, entertainment, and cultural programming to audiences around the world.

In the digital age, the internet and mobile telecommunications have revolutionized communication on a global scale. The internet, born out of military and academic research in the late 20th century, has become an indispensable tool for information exchange, social interaction, and commerce. Email, instant messaging, social media, and other online platforms have transformed the way individuals communicate, breaking down barriers of time and space.

Mobile telecommunications, enabled by wireless technology, have brought connectivity to remote and underserved regions, empowering individuals with access to voice and data services. Mobile phones have become ubiquitous tools for communication, enabling individuals to stay connected, access information, and participate in the digital economy.

In summary, communication networks, from ancient postal services to modern-day telecommunications, have played a crucial role in connecting people, facilitating commerce, and disseminating information across time and space. As technology continues to advance, communication networks will remain essential in shaping the way we interact and engage with the world around us.

In each of these three examples, the infrastructure provided essential services or resources that were foundational to the functioning of society. Similarly, digital public infrastructure encompasses the digital platforms, networks, and services that support modern economic, social, and civic activities in the digital age.

The advances in the digital technology enabled governments, NGOs, public and private companies, and other initiatives to utilise these technologies to increase the access to services. However, without the responsible and equitable transition process, introducing digital technologies can inhibit the access.


## From PI to DPI: Key Components

Considering the three examples presented as milestones in the public infrastructure, the progress in these last-longing domains can guide us to develop effective solutions in the area of DPI. Linking the topic with the equitable AI research and development, our main interest in the DPI development is building "trustworthy" solutions. So, understanding trustworthiness and defining "metrics" to measure the success is essential to develop "successful" applications.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has defined trustworthy AI systems through seven key characteristics: validity and reliability, safety, security and resilience, accountability and transparency, explainability and interpretability, privacy enhancement, and fair management of harmful bias. Each of these characteristics involves numerous subcomponents, contributing to the complexity of achieving a shared understanding and realisation of truly trustworthy AI. In this cookbook, we will also use the taxonomy and flavor it with UK's and EU's AI Safety guidelines and frameworks.


### Valid and Reliable

ISO 9000:2015 defines validation as the confirmation of requirements for a particular use case. ISO/IEC 5723:2022 defines reliability as the ability of an item to perform a specific action under certain conditions. The main challenge of adopting learning-based mechanisms in critical systems is providing reliable benchmarks for given different conditions. A rule-based system is in this sense much more reliable. However, with the industry-wide collaborations, we see an integration of AI-powered mechanisms by reinforcing the outcome reliability with human-in-the-loop approaches. 

Beyond the validity and reliability of a single product, we believe that these characteristics rely on the behaviour of the overall ecosystem. In this sense, industry collaborations and establishing standards are crucial. We have seen promising progress since generative AI has become widely available. For example, a recent industry-wide collaboration, including Adobe, Leica, Nikon, Sony, BBC, etc., is established to achieve digital content provenance. The [content credentials](https://contentauthenticity.org/how-it-works) are a digital watermark that proves the authenticity of the content. 

In addition, creating interoperable standards and protocols ensure compatibility and seamless communication between different systems and platforms. Connectivity plays a crucial role in facilitating interoperability, enabling data exchange and integration across diverse digital environments.

### Secure and Resilient

ISO/IEC TS 5723:2022 defines AI security and resilience as their ability of withstanding unexpected adverse events/changes. It requires a comprehensive analysis of the attack vector, possible threats and mitigations. Businesses follow different structured threat analysis approaches based on their needs and potential attack vectors. In our previous research, we offered a comprehensive approach encompassing three principal stages: (1) Human behaviour analysis, (2) Threat assessment (STRIDE and MITRE ATT\&CK), and (3) Enhancing resilience by analysing extended components (MITRE ATLAS). 

-	Map of adversarial attacks
-	Interdisciplinary and holistic security approach


Robust security protocols and privacy measures protect sensitive data and ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Connectivity is essential for implementing and maintaining these measures, facilitating secure data transmission and storage across digital networks.

### Accountable and Transparent

NIST defines AI transparency as the meaningful and appropriate level of access to the information related to AI lifecycle and its outputs. The accountability depends on this transparency.

Enhancing accountability requires a comprehensive analysis of organisational structures and responsibilities. Further, current regulations and policies do not adequately covers the level of required responsibilities.  

- Signing AI models (https://github.com/google/model-transparency?tab=readme-ov-file#projects) 
- Open initiatives make government data and information available to the public in accessible and machine-readable formats, fostering transparency, innovation, and collaboration. Connectivity enables widespread access to open data platforms, empowering users to leverage data for various purposes, including research, analysis, and decision-making.


### Explainable and Interpretable

NIST defines AI explainability as representing the underlying mechanisms of AI systems’ operation. The interpretability concept refers to the meaning of AI systems’ output in the context of their designed functional purposes.

- Explainability and visualisation studies

### Privacy Enhanced

The definition of privacy historically and philosophically changes over time, but in general it refers to the norms and practices to protect humans from potential harms related to human autonomy, identity, and dignity.

-	Federated models
-	Differential privacy

### Fair – with Harmful Bias Managed

Aligned with NIST, we define AI fairness as the overall effort to sustain equality and equity by preventing harmful bias and discrimination.

-	Despite the exhaustive efforts in the field, most AI models tend to demonstrate bias towards discrimination. Existing libraries/toolkits like AI360 has limited capabilities to uncover the bias in complex systems. The AI360 and similar tools works like a marketplace for existing techniques, which depends on the expertise of the user and nature of the selected problem. In an engineering project, we require more proactive approaches to capture potential fairness issues in multiple stages.  


### Safe

ISO/IEC TS 5723:2022 defines AI safety as its capability to prevent potential harm such as threats to human life, health, property, or the environment. Last year, the AI Summit put an initial effort into establishing a consensus and a shared language for AI safety among countries.

- METR AI Evaluation from DeepMind team (<https://metr.org/blog/2023-03-18-update-on-recent-evals/>)
- Human-value alignment is key to achieving AI safety.

Achieving safety in the AI and DPI systems only possible if we have "good-enough" metric results in other components.
